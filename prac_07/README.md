## Clean Code Lessons Learned

- Writing **modular code** by separating responsibilities into different functions and classes.
- Using **meaningful names** for variables, functions, and files to improve readability and maintainability.
- Applying **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** to avoid duplication and reduce complexity.
- Making use of **docstrings and comments** to clearly explain the purpose of each component.
- Keeping code **consistent and formatted** using tools like "Reformat Code" in PyCharm.
